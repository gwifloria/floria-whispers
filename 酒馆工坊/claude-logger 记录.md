利用 AI 辅助写代码的最大弊端：
注意力的切换

I believe many people who've coded with Claude have encountered this issue: when Claude presents a plan and pauses for our approval, we might get distracted and do something else. When Claude Code pauses before executing dangerous operations, it waits for our permission—and that's precisely when the problem occurs.

If I start seeking dopamine stimulation by browsing the internet, I become deeply absorbed in low-effort content that requires minimal attention and mental energy. This causes me to quickly skim through Claude's plans or warning messages without really engaging with them. I end up pressing enter without even looking carefully.

Later, when I encounter bugs that Claude has tried repeatedly but failed to fix, I realize the cost: wasted time and tokens.
