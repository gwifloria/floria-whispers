As a frontend developer, it's somewhat embarrassing to admit that I haven't established my own website until recently. The reason for this delay wasn't a lack of technical know-how, but rather uncertainty about the approach.

I've long been accustomed to taking notes in Obsidian. When contemplating publishing my blog on a personal website, my initial instinct was to build a comprehensive solution—complete with a text editor, database, APIs, and all the associated infrastructure. Moreover, I needed to account for synchronization, given how frequently one revises their writing, made all the more convenient by modern computing.

Since Obsidian is equipped with a Git plugin, it allows users to sync Markdown files effortlessly after configuring their Git account correctly. I realized that Git can also serve as a means of storing files. This led me to the idea that my personal website could fetch the repository from Obsidian.
