As a frontend developer, it's somewhat embarrassing to admit that I haven't established my own website until recently. The reason for this delay wasn't a lack of technical know-how, but rather uncertainty about the approach.

I've long been accustomed to taking notes in Obsidian. When contemplating publishing my blog on a personal website, my initial instinct was to build a comprehensive solution—complete with a text editor, database, APIs, and all the associated infrastructure. Moreover, I needed to account for synchronization, given how frequently one revises their writing, made all the more convenient by modern computing.

Since Obsidian is qualified with git pluguin which enables users to sync markdown files. I found that Git can also play a role of storing files. It occurs to me that my own website can fetch the repository of obsidian.
