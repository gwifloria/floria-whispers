As a frontend developer, it's somewhat embarrassing to admit that I haven't established my own website until recently. The reason for this delay wasn't a lack of technical know-how, but rather uncertainty about the approach.

I've long been accustomed to taking notes in Obsidian. When contemplating publishing my blog on a personal website, my initial instinct was to build a comprehensive solution—complete with a text editor, database, APIs, and all the associated infrastructure. Moreover, I needed to account for synchronization, given how frequently one revises their writing, made all the more convenient by modern computing.

Since Obsidian is equipped with a Git plugin, it allows users to sync Markdown files effortlessly after configuring their Git account correctly. I realized that Git can also serve as a means of storing files. This led me to the idea that my personal website could fetch the repository from Obsidian.
Specificly，
- i Still write in Obsidian
- Git plugin of Obsidian sync Files to GitHub automatically
- Website fetch the Github Repo File 

No worry for synchronization
No Effort for Data Storage and Apis 
No Need to Shift Writing Habits

Simply
Obsidian is still my notebook
Git is the tunnel
My own Website is just my gallery
