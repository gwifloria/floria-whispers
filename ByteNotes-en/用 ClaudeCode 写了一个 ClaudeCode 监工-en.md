This year, I have been experimenting with various AI programming tools to assist me in writing code.  
After subscribing to Copilot and GPT-5, I eventually chose ClaudeCode as my long-term companion.

Its _Plan Mode_ has proved remarkable — it embodies a refined philosophy of software creation:  
**plan in as much detail as possible before writing the very first line.**

Yet, unexpectedly, a new problem emerged.  
When ClaudeCode is fully engaged in the process, I often find myself at a loss — uncertain what to do while it works.  
More often than not, I end up idly scrolling through my phone, drifting from one app to another.

No matter whether it’s AI tools or human beings, when we receive a set of requirements or a production file, we should both take time to think deeply:

1. to understand the true intent behind the demands,
    
2. and to explore possible solutions to the problems.
    

Many would say that while waiting for AI to finish its work, we can grab a coffee, have a cup of tea, or simply do something else.  
But do we really have that much to do?  
How many cups of coffee can we drink in a day?

AI is supposed to enhance our efficiency — but has it, really?  
More and more people spend their “saved time” scrolling through social media.  
When we rely too heavily on AI, are we becoming smarter, or duller?

Social media and shortcuts have stolen much of our attention — and with it, our ability to think deeply.  
We are flooded with information we don’t truly need.  
So how can we reclaim the initiative — to **lead our own thoughts**, rather than being **led and shaped** by the very tools we created?

ClaudeCode provideds the hooks function which enables users to develop or config something personal such as notification 
But i believe many people's electronic devices have always been muted 
So What enlightened me?
When i was using clashX, the uploading & downloading statistics flashes all the time which distract me from focusing on my own job . So Should AI distract me from surfing on the internet to go back to focus on the job I asked ai todo . When it finished its' job, it's time for me to continue to give orders

Solutions
When claude is Working(maybe is searching,writing, or editing), swiftbar display a loading animation which means in progress so that there's no need for users to rapidly switch to terminal to check the working progress
when claudecode is waiting for users' confirmation before some dangerous steps, swiftbar displays ⚠️ to attract attention
when a task is completed,
