This year, I have been experimenting with various AI programming tools to assist me in writing code.  
After subscribing to Copilot and GPT-5, I eventually chose ClaudeCode as my long-term companion.

Its _Plan Mode_ has proved remarkable — it embodies a refined philosophy of software creation:  
**plan in as much detail as possible before writing the very first line.**

Yet, unexpectedly, a new problem emerged.  
When ClaudeCode is fully engaged in the process, I often find myself at a loss — uncertain what to do while it works.  
More often than not, I end up idly scrolling through my phone, drifting from one app to another.

No matter AI tools or human beings, when we are informed with the demands or production file, we both should think deeply
1. understand the requirements
2. looking for solutions to solve the problems

Many people would say that when we are waiting for AI completing it's work, we can grab a coffee ,take a cup of tea or doing something else.

But do we have so many things to deal with? how many cups of coffee do we drink a day?
AI is supposed to improve our proficiency but how about now? Many people spend their time on social media 
When we rely on AI too much, are we getting smarter or dumper?

Social media and shortcut have stolen many people's attraction and the ability to think deeply, we are overwhelmed with information which we may not need. 
So, how can we take back the lead to dominate our thoughts rather than manipulated by AI tools?

ClaudeCode provideds the hooks function which enables users to develop or config something personal such as notification
