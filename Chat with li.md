Today I went to the gym, and my advisor told me she's been considering seeing a psychologist about some mental issues. She and her husband have been raising their child in Shanghai completely on their own, without any help from grandparents. She puts enormous pressure on herself to be the perfect mother. It made me realize my life is way less stressful compared to parents like her.

So what's wrong with Chinese education?

The whole idea of "happy education" is basically impossible because everyone's competing with each other to have a better life.

What strikes me is that most people are comparing themselves to others rather than to their past selves. This isn't just a personal choice—it's structurally embedded in how our society operates. Social media has fundamentally transformed the nature of comparison. We're no longer just competing with our neighbors or classmates; we're unconsciously measuring ourselves against curated highlight reels from thousands of people worldwide.

The paradox is that this constant comparison was supposed to motivate us toward self-improvement, but instead it's breeding unprecedented levels of anxiety. Parents feel compelled to enroll their kids in endless extracurricular classes—not because they believe it will make their children happier, but because "other kids are doing it." The underlying assumption here is that falling behind in this race means condemning your child to a  life of low lvel. But does this perpetual race actually lead to fulfillment? Or just collective exhaustion?

What's particularly troubling is how this transforms education from a process of growth into a zero-sum game. At its core, learning should be about discovering your interests, developing critical thinking, and finding meaning. Yet when education becomes purely instrumental—a means to outcompete others—it loses its intrinsic value. We're no longer asking "What do I want to learn?" but rather "What will give me an edge?"

This speaks to a broader phenomenon about how we define a "better life." The crux of the matter is this: we've conflated "better" with "better than others" rather than "better than before." The former is a treadmill that never stops; the latter at least offers the possibility of satisfaction. One could argue that true progress—both individual and societal—requires shifting from relative comparisons to absolute ones. Not "Am I ahead of my peers?" but "Am I growing? Am I living according to my values?"
