# 香港游小记

So this time I'm going to write diary in English.
This honkong trip started with Blast (CSGO tournament). We've booked ticket of final competition 2months ago to enjoy esports compaigne offline.

Since our departure flight is about 7:50, so we've decided to spend our night at the airpot in our own car
The parking fee at P4 parking lot of Pudong International airport is acceptable compared to the taxi cost. This is our third time parking our own car
But the experience is quite back. I almost sleep like 3-4hours totally ? So next time, the flight of this time is definitely not our choice.

Traveling to Hon Kong is not a long trip which lasts less than 3 hours. What impressed me most during our first day before the competition is that we've spend 2 bi money
We took the wrong bus at the airpot. The hotel we've chosen is near to the expo as well as the airpot. The trip costs about 5minute ~10mintues . But I don't know why 3 map Apps provide us totally different options to travel to the hotel. So we randomly choose one which cost us 29hkd but a wrong routine while the bus headeed for wrong direction which don't meet our expectations.
The first meal we had at the department store cost us so lot. the price of Fried niuhe there is 138 hkd per dish which is double price compared to that of shanghai 

But the competition is so exciting since the audience will cheer together and the players were so astonishing which displayed extraordinaring caozuo in game. and my husband made a gamble on polymarket to take a guess about the winner and we succeeded making that lucky monkey of 100u. This amount cost a little and will make us more nervous about this game. But we agreed that if this gamble comes to 1000u, things will be diffrent
