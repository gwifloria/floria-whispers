This time, I'm going to write my diary in English.

Our Hong Kong trip started with Blast, a Counter-Strike tournament. We had booked tickets for the final competition two months ago to enjoy the esports event offline. Since our departure flight was at around 7:50 AM, we decided to spend the night at the airport in our own car. The parking fee at the P4 lot of Pudong International Airport was acceptable compared to the cost of a taxi. This was our third time parking there, but the experience was quite bad. I only managed to sleep 3-4 hours in total, so next time we will definitely avoid such an early morning flight.

The flight to Hong Kong is short—less than three hours. What stood out most on our first day before the competition was how much we spent. We took the wrong bus at the airport. Our hotel was located near both the expo and the airport, so the trip should have taken only 5-10 minutes. However, the three map apps we consulted gave us completely different routes. We randomly chose one that cost HKD 29, but it turned out to be the wrong direction, which was frustrating.

Our first meal at the department store was expensive. The fried rice noodles there cost HKD 138 per dish—double the price compared to Shanghai.

However, the competition itself was incredibly exciting. The audience cheered enthusiastically, and the players displayed extraordinary skill and gameplay. My husband made a prediction bet on Polymarket about the winner, and we won! We made a lucky gain of 100u (Units). This small amount made us even more nervous about the match, but we agreed that if the bet reaches 1000u, things would be very different.
