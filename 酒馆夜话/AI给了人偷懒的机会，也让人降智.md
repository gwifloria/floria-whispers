### **Opening**

First of all, I've decided to start writing in English as much as possible—to rebuild my writing skills to where they were five years ago. I'll use AI to help polish my drafts, and then translate them into Chinese afterward.

首先说明一下，我决定用英文写作来尽可能多地练习，目标是把写作能力恢复到五年前的水平。我会用 AI 帮忙润色，然后再翻译成中文。

Claude Code has been bothering me lately, and I'm starting to understand why. It's not that the tool doesn't work—it's good enough to handle simple tasks, but not good enough to read my mind. There's always a gap—between what I mean and what I say, between what it assumes and what my codebase actually needs.

最近 Claude Code 让我有点烦，它可以用来做些小任务，但又不够聪明，总是会出现一些 bug，毕竟人和机器的沟通还是会存在信息差

And here's the thing about human beings: we love shortcuts. When something seems to work automatically, we stop paying attention. 

人类有个通病：喜欢走捷径。只要一件事看起来能很轻松搞定，我们就放松休息

It wasn't until I saw AI repeatedly creating bugs—and failing to fix them—that I began to wonder: does Claude Code actually make me more productive?

直到我发现它在不断制造新的 bug、还修不好旧的 bug，我才开始怀疑：Claude Code 真的提升了我的生产力吗？

### **Why This Keeps Happening**

For those unfamiliar with Claude Code: it has a "plan mode" that shows you exactly what it's about to do before running anything So you can catch misunderstandings before they turn into problems.

对不了解的人解释一下：Claude Code 有个「计划模式」，会在执行前告诉你它详细的计划，在问题出现前发现误解

But when i was very tired, I found my self hit Enter before I check the plan or even glance at the plan. It feels effortless and takes less than 1sec

但是在我很累的时候，我发现我会直接按下回车，然后突然意识到我还没仔细看呢,按回车这件事太简单了

When something requires no effort, we stop being focused. We're no longer making conscious choices—we're just... clicking. The action becomes automatic, and our attention drifts—to the next thing, the next notification, the next dopamine hit.

当某件事不再需要任何努力时，我们的专注力就消失了。我们不再是主动选择，而只是机械地点击。注意力开始飘移——飘向下一件事、下一个通知、下一个多巴胺刺激。

### **What This Really Reveals**

This isn't really about Claude Code. It's about attention—and how easily we train ourselves to escape it.

这其实并不是在说 Claude Code，而是在说注意力——以及我们是如何一点点训练自己逃避它的。

I've been reading _Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise_ and _How to Break Up with Your Phone_. Both books hammer home the same truth: engagement. 

我最近在读《刻意练习》和《如何与手机分手》。这两本书都在反复强调一个道理：深度专注。

	｜If your mind is wandering or you're relaxed and just having fun, you probably won't improve
	“要记住：如果你在走神，或者你很放松，并且只为了好玩，你可能不会进步。”

So when we talk about productivity gains from AI tools, we often think less for ourselves but expect more from the tools. That habit may quietly train us to resist deep thinking.

所以当我们谈论「AI 提升生产力」时，我们往往自己思考得更少，却对工具要求得更多。久而久之，这种习惯会让我们越来越不愿意去做那些需要投入和思考的事。

If we're constantly distracted—unwilling to slow down, unwilling to "waste time" really absorbing something—then years from now, will we still be capable of deep or even independent thinking?

如果我们一直这样被分心、不愿放慢脚步、不愿「浪费时间」去真正吸收一些东西——多年之后，我们还会具备深度思考、甚至基本思考的能力吗？

### **The Choice**

Claude Code is just a tool—we should develop the ability to reduce the repetitive work as much as possible instead of getting dominated by doing nothing requires engagement and effort
Claude Code 只是一个工具——一面反映我们如何对待工作的镜子。带着专注和意图，它能放大我们的能力

是否希望我帮你再润成更"公众号文风"的版本（比如在英文段落前加一句简短的中文引导语，让中英文过渡更自然，整体更适合阅读）？  
那种版本会更贴近"思考类公众号"常用的节奏，比如 **小标题 + 一句口语化中文 + 英文正文** 的排版风格。
