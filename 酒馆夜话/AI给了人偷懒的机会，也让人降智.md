**Opening**

First of all, I've decided to start writing in English to practice as much as possible. My goal is to rebuild my writing skills to where they were five years ago. I'll use AI to help polish these pieces and translate them into Chinese afterward.

Claude Code has been bothering me lately, and I'm starting to understand why. It's not that the tool doesn't work— it's good enough to make me _think_ I can relax, but not good enough to actually read my mind. There's always a gap—between what I mean and what I communicate, between what it assumes and what my codebase actually needs.

And here's the thing about humans: we love taking shortcuts. When something seems to work automatically, we stop paying attention. We hit Enter without reading the plan, thinking we're saving time and mental energy. But we're not saving anything. We're just trading one kind of effort (careful review) for another kind (frantic debugging). We think we're being lazy, but we're actually making more work for ourselves—just later, when it's harder to fix.


**开篇**

首先说明一下，我决定用英文写作来尽可能多地练习，目标是把写作能力恢复到五年前的水平。我会用 AI 帮忙润色，然后翻译成中文。

最近 Claude Code 一直困扰着我。不是因为工具不好用——它好用到让我以为可以偷懒，但又不足以真正满足我的需求——有时候个人表述不是很清晰完整

而人类都是喜欢偷懒的。当某件事看起来能省力时，我们就不再专注了。我们不读计划就按回车，以为这样能省时间、省脑子。但我们什么都没省下来。我们只是把一种努力（仔细审查）换成了另一种努力（疯狂调试）。我们以为自己在偷懒，实际上是在给自己找更多的活——只是推迟到了后面，那时候更难收拾。

**Why This Keeps Happening**

The pattern is simple and disturbingly familiar. Claude generates a plan, I glance at it for maybe 5-10 seconds, and hit Enter. It feels effortless—exactly like scrolling through my phone. No mental load, no friction, just a quick tap.

And that's exactly the problem.

When something requires no effort, we stop being present. We're not making a conscious decision anymore; we're just... clicking. The action becomes automatic, and our attention drifts elsewhere—to the next thing, the next notification, the next dopamine hit.

For those unfamiliar with Claude Code: it has a "plan mode" that shows you exactly what it's about to do before it does it. This is supposed to be a safety net—a chance to catch misunderstandings before they become problems. But I've turned it into just another thing to scroll past.


**为什么一直发生**

这个模式简单得可怕，而且熟悉得令人不安。Claude 生成一个计划，我扫一眼大概 5-10 秒，然后按回车。感觉毫不费力——就像刷手机一样。没有心智负担，没有摩擦，只是快速一按。

这正是问题所在。

当某件事不需要任何努力时，我们就不再专注了。我们不再做有意识的决定，只是...点击。这个动作变成自动的，我们的注意力飘到了别处——下一件事、下一个通知、下一个多巴胺刺激。

对不了解的人解释一下：Claude Code 有个"计划模式"，会在执行之前准确告诉你它要做什么。这本应是一个安全网——在误解变成问题之前发现它的机会。但我把它变成了又一个可以划过去的东西。

**What This Really Reveals**

This isn't really about Claude Code. It's about something deeper—about attention and how we've trained ourselves to avoid it.

I've been reading _Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise_ and _How to Break Up with Your Phone_ lately. Both books hammer home the same truth: you can't fake deep focus. Real learning, real skill development—it all requires you to actually pay attention, not just skim the surface while your mind's somewhere else.

We've spent years training ourselves to do exactly the opposite. Years of scrolling, bouncing between apps, never sitting with anything for more than a few seconds. We've literally rewired our brains for distraction.

So when we talk about productivity gains from AI tools, we're often asking the wrong question. It's not "how fast can I get this done?" The real question is: "do I actually know what I want, and am I present enough to make sure I'm getting it?"

Because if we're constantly distracted, if we're unwilling to slow down and actually think—to "waste time" really absorbing something—then honestly, what are we even learning?


**这真正揭示了什么**

这其实不是关于 Claude Code，而是关于更深层的东西——关于注意力，以及我们如何训练自己逃避它。

我最近在读《刻意练习》和《如何与手机分手》。两本书都反复强调同一个真理：深度专注这事儿没法装。真正的学习、真正的技能发展——都需要你真的去专注，而不是表面扫一眼，心思早飘到别处去了。

我们花了好几年时间训练自己做完全相反的事。好几年的刷手机、在各个应用之间跳来跳去、从不在任何东西上停留超过几秒钟。我们真的把大脑重新训练成分心模式了。

所以当我们谈论 AI 工具带来的生产力提升时，我们经常问错了问题。问题不是"我能多快完成这个？"真正的问题是："我真的知道我想要什么吗？我足够专注去确保我得到的就是我要的吗？"

因为如果我们一直在分心，如果我们不愿意慢下来真正思考——不愿意"浪费时间"去真正吸收一些东西——那说实话，我们到底在学什么？

**The Choice**

Claude Code is just a tool—a mirror reflecting how we approach our work. If we bring mindfulness and intention, it amplifies our capabilities. If we bring our scrolling habits and fragmented attention, it just becomes another expensive distraction.

The choice, as always, is ours.


**选择**

Claude Code 只是一个工具——一面反映我们如何对待工作的镜子。如果我们带来专注和意图，它会放大我们的能力。如果我们带来刷屏习惯和碎片化注意力，它就只是另一个昂贵的干扰。

选择，一如既往，在我们手中。
