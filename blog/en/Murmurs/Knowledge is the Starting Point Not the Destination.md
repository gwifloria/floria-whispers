# Knowledge is the Starting Point, Not the Destination: From Rapid Acquisition to Deep Immersion

## Reflections on Reading Meng Jian AI

### 1. Core Cognitions About Growth

> Communication skills are more important than programming skills / In the workplace, what matters most isn't what you said, but how you said it
> Influence is more important than individual output
> Team collaboration is more important than individual heroism

Even outside the workplace, these are important.

> Create assets, don't sell time
> Shift from employee mindset to entrepreneurial mindset, embrace change, keep learning

I agree with this point, but don't know exactly how to do it yet.

> Technology is the foundation, soft skills determine the ceiling. Choose the era, not the technology.

I used to be like this, fixated on technology (not that intensely), completely ignoring other things. This is kind of like being a robot, replaceable, and also wooden, without thinking.

### 2. About Focus and Internal Friction

> Resolve internal friction, internal friction consumes most of your energy, making it impossible to do other things
> Maintain focus: practice sustaining focus for long periods doing anything
> Slacking off also consumes energy, just like short videos waste energy, even if you think you're resting

This is why I now get up immediately when I wake up.

I used to think I wasn't awake yet—needed to play with phone a while before getting up—by the time I got up, attention had already been highly consumed.

### 3. About Energy and Relationships

> People with lower energy than you will doubt you, deny you, envy you.
> People with same frequency energy will like you, affirm you, appreciate you.
> People with higher energy than you will understand you, accommodate you, fulfill you.

Suddenly I can feel at peace with the doubts and denials from people around me. Those who doubt me are necessarily not on my frequency—Liu Qing definitely wouldn't doubt me. Haha

### 4. About Reading and Learning

#### The Trap of Information Anxiety

I find myself often falling into a kind of anxiety.

For example, when reading an article from the second half, wanting to go back to the first half makes me confused, and my notes become chaotic too. I think: I didn't think through some points earlier, need to flip back, but there's so much unread, why waste time rereading? So I start skimming. At the same time I wonder: should I organize my reading notes following the author's heading structure? Should I pay attention to their hierarchy tags? Feels like a waste of time.

I think I'm not the only one with this struggle. In the age of information explosion, everyone craves rapid acquisition of unknown knowledge.

#### Reunderstanding Learning

**But knowledge isn't the destination, it's the starting point.**

I didn't expect to read such a simple yet philosophical sentence in a design book. But after understanding what design itself is, coming from a design master, it makes sense.

#### The Value of Depth and Slowness

I'm also easily attracted by golden quotes in books, then eager to finish the whole book.

But golden quotes are just golden quotes after all, a book may not have that many golden quotes. If time isn't abundant, having deep insights from one paragraph or sentence in a book is also very valuable. Recently borrowed "The Crescent Moon Collection," attracted by its thin volume and beautiful layout.

Suppose I only had one poetry collection at hand, I might worry about reading too fast, having nothing else to flip through after finishing. Then I'd read books like eating expensive chocolate: reading very slowly, eating very slowly. But in this "slow" process, perhaps I could focus more on the chocolate's delicate and rich flavor.

So I wonder, could reading just one four-line love poem per week also produce a thousand-word reflection?

### 5. About White Space and Focus in Practice

**Don't need continuous input, must leave time to zone out**

Cooking works, but why did I used to watch videos while cooking? Wished the kitchen had a tablet stand too.

Actually cooking is a very comfortable activity, during which you can be fully focused:

1. Feel the natural aroma of vegetables while prepping (meat smells)
2. Feel ingredients' passionate struggle with cookware after going into the pan
3. The delicious aroma as the dish nears completion

And during this process there's a foreseeable beautiful result, provided you're not hungry to the point of stomach touching backbone.
