# Book Notes 📚 "Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise"

## Introduction - Do Geniuses Really Exist?

> Perfect pitch isn't a talent, but the ability to develop perfect pitch is indeed a gift.
> (This "perfect pitch" can be substituted with any "talent")

- Genius is a product of training
- But not repetitive mechanical, mindless training
- Today's learning is a way to **create ability**, not simply utilizing existing talent
- Learning isn't about discovering potential, but **developing potential**
- We've always overestimated the role of "innate talent" and underestimated the value of opportunity, motivation, and effort

## Chapter 1: Purposeful Practice

> - Having clearly defined goals: Effectively guides your practice
> - Purposeful practice is focused: To improve, you must concentrate
> - Purposeful practice includes feedback: Identify shortcomings, find causes
> - Purposeful practice requires stepping out of your comfort zone

**What to do when hitting a plateau?**
- Not "try harder things," but "try different things"
- Most times it's not the limit, but **insufficient motivation**
- Meaningful positive feedback is key to maintaining motivation
  - Internal feedback: Seeing your own ability improve
  - External feedback: Evaluation from others

## Chapter 2: The Brain's Adaptability

The brain's structure and operation will change in response to mental training just like muscles and cardiovascular system respond to exercise.

> **The brain is like muscle, the more you train the stronger it gets**
> - Taxi drivers have larger **posterior hippocampus**: Because they constantly need to plan routes
> - Bus drivers only drive fixed routes, hippocampus differences are significant
> - The brain has unlimited adaptability, but the body prefers stability
> - When feeling pressure, adjusts to restore balance

> **Challenge and Adaptation**
> - Greater challenge, greater change, but not excessive
> - Adult brain cells don't divide infinitely, but can achieve through **rewiring**:
>   - Strengthen or weaken neural connections
>   - Add new connections or discard old ones
> - **Optimal change comes from challenges "outside comfort zone but not too far"**

**From Intelligence to Physical**
- Mathematicians: Longer research time, more gray matter in inferior parietal lobule
- Cognitive and physiological changes induced by training need to be maintained, otherwise they'll disappear

**Key Insights**
- Potential can be constructed, not predetermined by birth
- The goal of deliberate practice: **Not discovering but constructing potential**
- Learning isn't executing genetic destiny, but **taking control of destiny** and selectively shaping potential

## Chapter 3: Mental Representations

> **Meaningful memory is more efficient**

- Chess grandmasters: Can remember about 2/3 of a game position in 5 minutes, beginners only remember about 4 pieces
- On random positions, masters aren't better than beginners → **The key is pattern, not memory**
- Training lets chess players form "chunks" that quickly identify patterns

**Seeing both trees and forest**
- Mental representations encode not just piece positions, but also relationships, situations, and potential moves
- Masters can quickly judge situations and focus on specific pieces when needed
- → Beginners can only see "trees," masters see "forest" and can also see "trees"

**Definition of Mental Representation**
- A mental structure corresponding to an object, idea, information, or abstract concept
- One core of deliberate practice is **creating mental representations**
- Mental representations create outstanding performance

**Pattern Recognition and Decision Making**
- Quarterbacks (American football): The best ones are often those who spend the most time in the video room
- Through constant watching and analyzing game videos, mental representations form →
  - Can quickly track whole-field dynamics
  - Can recall details in post-game
  - Can quickly make excellent decisions on field

**Mental Representations Help Explain Information**
- One important benefit of mental representation is that it can help us process information: understand and interpret it, save it in memory, organize it, analyze it, and use it for decision-making
- For a news story about a football or baseball game, the key factor determining how much someone understands is how much they know about the sport. The reason is simple and direct: if you don't know much about the sport, all the details you read are basically a series of unrelated facts, no easier to remember than a random list of words. If you know something about the sport, you've already built a mental structure for explaining it, organizing information, and integrating it with all other related information you've absorbed. New information becomes part of an ongoing story, thus transferring to your long-term memory more quickly and easily, allowing you to remember much of the article.

Personal note: So any type of book can start from introductory level, lower professionalism.

**Mental Representations Help Organize Information**
- One major advantage of carefully created mental representations is: you can immediately absorb and consider more information. Scientists studying professional diagnostic doctors found that these doctors often don't view patient symptoms as isolated information, but as part of a larger whole. The way they observe patients is like how chess grandmasters observe the board—never seeing pieces as isolated unrelated individuals, but as part of the whole game.

Building mental representations is like climbing stairs while building new steps. Each step you climb brings you to a place where new steps need to be built.

Your existing mental representations guide your performance and enable you to both monitor and judge whether your performance is good or bad. As you push yourself to do things you haven't done before—like cultivating a new skill or honing an existing one—you're also expanding and optimizing your mental representations. With mental representations expanded and optimized, you can do things excellently that you've never done before.

## Chapter 6: Using Golden Practice Principles in Daily Life

### Breaking Wrong Thinking

> "The first wrong idea is our old friend—believing that one's abilities are usually limited by genetic characteristics. This thinking often manifests as various 'I can't' or 'I'm not' statements: 'I'm not a very creative person.' 'I can't manage others well.' 'I'm not good with numbers.' 'I can't do better than this.' But as we've learned, in any industry or field where people choose to focus on development, everyone can help themselves significantly improve through correct training. We can shape our potential."

### The Importance of Focus and Engagement

> "Remember: if you're distracted, or you're relaxed and just doing it for fun, you probably won't improve."

> "Whether amateur or professional singers, compared to before class, they felt more relaxed and energized after class, but only amateur singers reported feeling particularly elated after class. Singing training made amateur singers, not professional singers, feel happy. The reason for this difference is how the two groups of singers approached training. For amateur singers, in class they could express inner feelings, sing love songs, and feel the pure joy of singing. For professional singers, in class they focused on observing voice techniques, breath control, etc., striving to improve their skills."

**Personal feeling:** Perhaps what I like about Pilates is that I can focus only on my own sensations for 1 hour, so I feel great after class.

> "Focus and engagement are crucial, therefore, setting clear goals and shortening practice session duration is the best way to more quickly improve new skill levels. Investing 100% effort in shorter time periods is more effective than investing only 70% effort over longer periods."

### Core Practice Principles

> "Focus, feedback, and fix it. Break down skills into component parts to practice repeatedly, effectively analyze and identify your shortcomings, then think of various ways to solve them."

### Breaking Through Plateaus

> "This is true for everyone who hits a plateau: the best way to get past this plateau is to challenge your brain or body in new ways."

> "In fact, most of them proactively vary their training modes so they don't hit plateaus from the start. Various types of cross-training are based on this same principle—switching between different types of training so you can continuously challenge yourself in different ways."

### The Challenge of Maintaining Motivation

> "Maintaining motivation is perhaps the biggest problem every person engaged in purposeful practice or deliberate practice will eventually face."

> "There's almost no scientific evidence that there exists some general 'willpower' applicable in any situation."

> "Therefore, there's no scientific evidence that there's a single gene in our bodies that determines willpower; similarly, there's no scientific evidence that our bodies contain genes necessary for success in chess or piano performance. Furthermore, once you assume someone's talent is innate, it automatically becomes something you're powerless to change: if you don't have innate musical talent, forget about becoming an outstanding musician. If you don't have enough willpower, don't think about jobs requiring tremendous arduous effort. This circular thinking (like 'I can't persist in practice, this is fact, showing I don't have enough willpower; and I don't have enough willpower, this is also fact, explaining why I can't persist in practice') is completely harmful. It's extremely destructive because it can make people believe they shouldn't even try in fields where they have no talent."

### Components and Maintenance of Motivation

> "Maintaining this motivation to keep the system running includes two components: reasons to keep going and reasons to stop. You stop doing what you wanted to do because reasons to stop eventually overcome reasons to keep going. Therefore, to maintain motivation, either strengthen reasons to keep going or weaken reasons to stop."

> "As long as you can recognize that this new identity comes from your long-term hard practice, focusing on improving your skills, further practice feels more like an investment than a cost."

> "Another important motivational factor in deliberate practice is believing you can succeed. When you really don't like your current state, to push yourself, you must believe you can improve and join the ranks of the best, especially for those aiming to become outstanding in their industry or field. This belief's power is strong, even able to defeat reality."

> "If you no longer believe you can achieve a goal, either because your level has declined or because you've hit a plateau, at this point, never give up halfway."

### Social Motivation and External Support

> "One of the strongest forms of external motivation is social motivation. This can manifest in several ways. The simplest and most direct is recognition and admiration from others."

> "Surrounding yourself with supportive people is easiest in activities completed by groups or teams."

> "Franklin created this club, not only ensuring he regularly had contact with the people most interested in scholarship in Philadelphia, but also giving him stronger motivation to delve deeply into these subjects. He knew he had to raise at least one interesting question each week and answer questions from others, which gave him extra motivation to read and research the most pressing and intellectually challenging matters in science, politics, and philosophy of that era."

> "Gather all people interested in the same thing, or attract them to join an existing group, and use the group's camaraderie and shared goals as extra motivation to achieve your own goals."

### Goal Breakdown and Reward Mechanisms

> "Break the long journey into a series of controllable goals, focus on only one at a time, and even give yourself small rewards each time you reach a goal."

### 📌 Chapter 6 Summary

This chapter provides a practical guide for applying deliberate practice to daily life:

**Core principles**: Focus, feedback, fix it - short intense practice is more effective than long low-intensity practice.

**Breaking through obstacles**: Plateaus require challenging yourself in new ways, not harder ways; cross-training can continuously stimulate brain adaptation.

**Motivation management**: Motivation involves the struggle between "keep going" and "stop" forces. Maintaining motivation requires:

- Breaking the harmful thinking of "talent determinism"
- Cultivating identity recognition, making practice feel like investment rather than cost
- Maintaining the belief "I can succeed"
- Utilizing social support and group power
- Breaking long-term goals into controllable small goals

The key is recognizing that abilities can be shaped, not limited by genes.
