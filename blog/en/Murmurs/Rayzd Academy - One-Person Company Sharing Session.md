On August 20, 2025, I attended a "One-Person Company" sharing session hosted at Rayzd Academy. Six speakers presented that evening, and one of them far exceeded my expectations, leaving me completely immersed throughout. While the others weren't as impactful, they still left me with some memorable moments: someone emphasized how running a one-person company gives you clearer visibility over all projects, someone boldly started a business despite being unfamiliar with the industry, and another came across like they'd graduated from a "celebrity training camp" but reminded me—if the urge to share is overwhelming, write it down and turn it into an article. Each of these brought some food for thought.

## **In the AI Era, Don't Let Your Thinking Atrophy**

The speaker who impressed me most was the second one, an AIGC design developer **@ZayG**. He not only discussed the conveniences AI brings to one-person companies but also pointed out the challenges individuals face in this era of fragmented information.

He said: **AI doesn't necessarily enhance our abilities—it might actually cause them to atrophy.**

He showed a design related to green plants and explained it was an expression of "involution culture." I didn't quite understand at the time, so I asked him afterward. He explained: Many people keep houseplants now, but the plant's placement, watering frequency, and fertilization schedule are all decided by humans. If the plant had its own will, would it make the same choices?

This struck a chord with me. Many people are no different from these houseplants—passively receiving "nutrients" fed by the outside world, rarely making active choices or thinking for themselves.

He summarized the three capabilities individuals need most today:

1. **Information Power**: Replace repetitive labor, strengthen deep analysis
2. **Creative Power**: Expand creative possibilities, reduce trial-and-error costs
3. **Influence Power**: Amplify content reach, deepen user connections

**I especially agree that creativity and influence cannot be replaced by AI.** AI can summarize existing information, but truly building connections and generating new insights still depends on our own knowledge networks and brains.

However, I also sensed that many people in the audience didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of large language models. Some naively believed AI could do anything. One person asked: **"How do you stimulate AI's creativity?"**

I thought to myself: If ChatGPT were truly a wizard, why not just ask it—"How do I become a billionaire?"

This made me realize that atrophy isn't limited to thinking—it might extend further into our **emotions and lifestyles**.

## **Is a Girlfriend Worse Than AI?**

The last group to present included an architect who, with his female partner, was building a companion app. The UI looked like a blue version of period tracking apps—honestly, a bit dated. They believed AI could provide emotional value and responses that exceed expectations.

What bothered me more was his example: **When you come home from work full of negative emotions, telling your girlfriend is worse than telling AI—because your girlfriend might not want to listen to you complain, and her response might not be ideal, while AI could give you a more "rational," more understanding answer.**

I understand this line of thinking, but I don't agree. It's like a conversational version of Xiaohongshu/Douyin: the more you use it, the better it "knows" you, even defining "what you need" for you.

Think about the past: when we opened a browser, we first had to think "what do I want to search for"; today, open any app and it's already decided "what you should see." Even payment apps are pushing irrelevant junk information.

**Thus, we've lost the initial step of thinking.**

We might have started just wanting a bit of dopamine, but we ended up trapped in unconscious scrolling. As the author of *The Anxious Generation* mentioned, swiping might be the quickest action humans can acquire—even infants can do it.

Humans aren't robots, and emotions can't be completely "rationalized." Life has too many unpredictable moments—maybe a beautiful view appears and bad mood dissolves instantly.

The future of such software might require implanting chips in your body: recording what you eat, what you see, monitoring hormone fluctuations, then pushing so-called "appropriate responses." **This is handing your emotions entirely to your phone and algorithms, turning yourself into a robot.**

I thought of the book I'm reading, *Why I Only Want to Stay Home*, which asks: Why doesn't architecture study knowledge related to "people"? And this architect who switched careers probably never studied that either.

Rationalism is important, but life can't be entirely arranged by algorithms. **What people really need is understanding, not calculated "optimal solutions."**

**This might be the greatest challenge of our era: the atrophy of active thinking.**

Therefore, I won't be the target user of companion apps. If I had another chance, I'd definitely confront that "companion bro" on the spot.

It reminds me of a saying: **AI will first replace "test-takers."**
Because test-taking relies on standard answers, while true thinking and creation—no algorithm can do that for us.
