# What is the Nature of Procrastination?

Recently I've been reading "Feeling Good" by David Burns. This book talks about self-help methods for depression, anxiety, as well as anger, procrastination, etc.

The author mentions at the beginning that you need to do written exercises, write down your thoughts, then analyze them against cognitive distortions.

But... I even procrastinated on "filling out the forms" for a long time.

Yet I don't procrastinate on showering, eating, or scrolling my phone—just can't muster the energy for certain things. So I started wondering: why can I do some things immediately while always delaying others?

I found that procrastination for me isn't so-called "lack of self-control," but fear.

For example, when doing written exercises, I would overestimate the effort "writing" would require. I was also afraid that what I wrote down would make me more anxious, and afraid that even after writing, the problem wouldn't be solved.

So I'd rather delay it.

The book suggests writing out negative thoughts, then finding alternative positive thoughts by comparing them to "cognitive distortions." For example:

---

Here are the cognitive distortions:

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**
    - Things are either good or bad, no gray area.
    - Example: Didn't get perfect score on exam, feels like a complete failure.

2. **Overgeneralization**
    - Using one negative experience to draw an overall pessimistic conclusion.
    - Example: One date didn't go well, concludes "I can never have love."

3. **Mental Filter**
    - Only focusing on negative details, ignoring the overall positive.
    - Example: Only one criticism among praises, spends the whole day dwelling on that negative comment.

4. **Disqualifying the Positive**
    - Thinking positive experiences don't count, always negating the positive parts.
    - Example: Others praise your good work, you say "just lucky."

5. **Jumping to Conclusions**
    - Making negative inferences without evidence.
    - **Mind Reading**: Assuming others think negatively of you.
    - **Fortune Telling**: Convinced things will go badly.

6. **Magnification / Minimization**
    - Exaggerating problems or flaws, minimizing strengths or achievements.
    - Example: Small mistakes blown up to "disaster," efforts are belittled.

7. **Emotional Reasoning**
    - Feeling "I feel this way → so it must be true."
    - Example: Because I feel worthless, concludes I really am worthless.

8. **Should Statements**
    - Imposing rigid "should/must" rules on yourself or others.
    - Example: "I must be perfect, otherwise I'm a failure."

9. **Labeling and Mislabeling**
    - Instead of addressing specific behavior, using completely negative words to define yourself or others.
    - Example: "I didn't complete the task → I'm useless."

10. **Personalization**
    - Thinking bad things happen because of yourself.
    - Example: Colleague is in bad mood, thinks it's because you said something wrong.

Actually there are many similar points. "The Anxious Generation" also mentions that catastrophizing and polarized thinking are thought traps that cause depression and anxiety in students.

- I worry written exercises will slow down reading → Actually won't, exercises help understanding
- I think slow progress will affect plans → But plans can be adjusted
- I'm afraid exercises won't work and emotions won't improve → But never trying means never having a chance to improve

After writing it down, it feels somewhat lighter.

Actually thinking back to student days, what I procrastinated on most was essays. Always delayed until the last minute, even staying up late to scribble a few sentences. The reason was simple: my essay grades were always bad, no confidence. In contrast, math and science homework got done quickly.

This made me realize: anything I feel "not good at," I unconsciously avoid. Even things I enjoy, once I hit a bottleneck, I stop rather than break through.

But ultimately, so what if I can't get past the bottleneck?

So now I think what's hidden behind procrastination isn't laziness, but fear of imperfection.

I need to allow myself to be imperfect.
