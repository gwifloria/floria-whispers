First, let me answer: **No, there's nothing wrong with it.**

## Interview Questions in the AI Era

I recently had an interview that started with 7-8 handwritten coding questions.

The questions were almost identical to what I encountered four years ago when changing jobs—all high-frequency questions from the internet. I knew I should prepare, but I just couldn't bring myself to—even though it would only take a few hours to review.

The result was predictable: I didn't perform well.

But I'm not going to doubt myself over this. I'm still confident even though I can't answer these questions now (though I'm not entirely sure if that's a good thing—from a psychological resilience perspective, it probably is).

## My Abilities Are Not the Problem

At my previous company, the Leader I worked with was a graduate student from Jiao Tong University, and my frontend colleague was a graduate student from Beihang University. Their evaluation of me was consistently **"exceeded expectations."**

Once I designed a component and my colleague was surprised by its clever design. He asked: "How did you come up with this?" I said I happened to be learning about React Hooks' elegant design—at that time, I was hand-writing React source code.

I had completely typed through BuildYourOwnReact in my spare time to learn the design philosophy. (But in this interview, I found I couldn't say a single word about it ☹️, and even now I can't remember what that fantastic component I designed was for.)

My Leader later told a newly joined senior frontend developer: "I think she's a very smart person. Her problem-solving and design thinking are excellent. I hope you'll mentor her well."

My performance reviews always landed in the top 3 within the team, alongside two backend developers.

I don't think my abilities are the problem. **My issues are: poor interview skills, and a destructive resistance to test-taking.**

## This Isn't Just My Confusion

When I changed jobs the first time, I dutifully reviewed all the standard interview questions and LeetCode problems. I didn't understand many things back then, so learning felt fresh—it was like filling in gaps.

The 40+ articles in each of these folders—**I've read them all**. Of course, that's not everything I've read, but definitely not during interview prep time.

But my biggest problem is: **I never produced secondary output in my own words.**

Preparing for the second job change, I suddenly realized: **Do I really have to go through a "cramming for exams" phase like preparing for college entrance exams every time I switch jobs?**

The second time was more painful than the first. Many things I clearly understood, but I still couldn't explain clearly. This gap between "knowing but can't articulate" is more frustrating than "not knowing."

**Knowledge is the starting point, not the destination.**

If I prepare during interview season, I'm mostly just **racing toward some endpoint, and the process of connecting knowledge definitely isn't happening at that moment**—cramming at the last minute is just temporary coping.

I really like something my former Leader often said: **"You can deceive others, but don't deceive yourself."**

Chatting with former colleagues recently, they also said:

**"Knowledge you don't use daily, you just can't articulate. Algorithms you don't practice, you just forget."**

That moment I realized: **This isn't just my problem—it's most people's reality.**

**Even CS majors—if asked about knowledge learned in school now, could they give complete and comprehensive answers?**

Ask me professional questions now and I've probably forgotten everything, but that doesn't mean my education was wasted.

If I want to answer principle questions fluently in interviews, I just need to practice more of these questions—it's not hard. I shouldn't be completely passive just because I'm the interviewee. I need to ask questions back too.

## But the Interview Mechanism Itself Isn't Wrong

From another angle, the interview process actually makes sense. External interviewers don't know you and must judge in one hour whether someone is reliable.

The lowest-cost approach is: **Standard interview questions + LeetCode.**

Just like how companies base offers on your previous salary—not entirely reasonable, but it is an actionable reference standard.

So I won't complain about this mechanism; it has its logic.

When my former Leader talked about an employee who jumped from a famous big company to ours, he said: **"Some people have strong abilities themselves, but they're not necessarily great at interviewing. Some people are just particularly good at interviewing."**

**I believe answering correctly doesn't necessarily mean strong fundamentals, but it definitely means well-prepared.**

## So What Am I Going to Do?

I started asking myself a more fundamental question: If I don't want to "cram for exams" every time, is there a way to let others know I can deliver without grinding problems or memorizing?

The answer is actually simple: **Polish yourself as a product daily, make your highlights visible to others.**

Looking back, those highlights at my previous company—the problem wasn't that they didn't happen, but that **they weren't documented, weren't output as visible things.**

If I had written a retrospective after every problem solved, preparing for interviews today wouldn't be "cramming" but **reviewing my own notes.**

I remember something my former Leader often said: **Focus on your Reputation.**

After long-term team collaboration, who's reliable, who's coasting, who can handle pressure—it's all clear.

When your Reputation is established, good opportunities naturally find you more easily.

## Final Thoughts

I still don't plan to cram for any interview. Interviews are two-way selections, and AI is pushing people from all roles into this wave.

**But I'll still want to practice algorithms regularly—I think it's good for the brain.**

**I'll still read technical documentation to understand underlying logic, but must process and output again.**

My memory is just really poor. If asked two years later why I left my previous company, I might only be able to say **"wasn't happy."**

As for the journey I can articulate now—**I'll eventually forget it**, but that doesn't mean this thinking process is meaningless to my life.

Because I'm not a philosophy educator—I can't discuss philosophy every day.

Similarly: **I'm not a development engineering instructor—I'm not explaining principles all day.**

But I've also figured out what to do next:

**Continuously output daily thinking and practice, record what I've learned in my own words again, make abilities visible.**

P.S. **Life really is a practice.**

The night before this interview I slept maybe 3 hours. The old me would definitely have had a mental breakdown—before, whether working or not, if I slept too little I'd assume the day was ruined. That's emotional reasoning too. And there's a good chance I would have ditched the interview lol.

But not this time~! I'm awesome!

Now I really want to sleep!!! Why am I still writing a blog post 😖orz
