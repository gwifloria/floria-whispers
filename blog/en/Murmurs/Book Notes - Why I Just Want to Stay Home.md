# Book Notes 📚 "Why I Just Want to Stay Home"

The author of this book founded the world's first happiness research institute, dedicated to exploring the causes of happiness.

It mainly talks about Danish interior design language—how people living in Nordic countries create a home that makes them feel happy.

### Natural Light and Happiness

> Compared to artificial light sources, most people prefer natural light. Who doesn't like having a big window next to their workstation? Trees are more pleasant than bricks. These preferences aren't just determined by aesthetics—they're directly related to psychological well-being.
>
> A large study by the World Health Organization on European housing and health conditions showed that insufficient daylight or poor window views increased residents' likelihood of depression by 60% and 40% respectively.

### Human Perception and Design

> Why aren't architects interested in people anymore? Why don't architecture schools teach anything about people? Why don't I and my colleagues consider how the buildings we design will affect how people feel?
>
> Cities are designed from a bird's-eye view from above. Urban design should focus on how the city is perceived by the human body, not how it looks from above.

### Home Details

- Plants can add vitality to a room
- Books can bring an atmosphere of contemplation and exploration
- Carpets and wall art add warm texture
- A floor lamp beside the sofa quietly whispers: "Grab that book from the shelf and sit next to me to read."

When we did our whole-home customization, we had the same feeling: a good designer should be someone who truly experiences time at home.

> People spend more time indoors, and for more people, indoors means home.

#### 🪟 Lighting and Spatial Perception

- If people are satisfied with the lighting in their home, their likelihood of being satisfied with their home increases by 10%
- Light increases spatial perception; adding another window is a good way to make a cramped space feel more spacious
- A fun lamp can be added to corners

---

#### 📐 Increase Space, Not Area

- Some people feel their home is crowded because rooms are too small, but actually the key factor isn't house size, but "sense of spaciousness"
- A big house can feel small, while a small house can feel spacious

#### 💡 Consumption and Happiness

- The sweetness of cheap things you'll quickly forget, but the bitterness of poor quality will linger in your heart
- We usually buy new things because of fantasies associated with them
- Getting others' recognition is because of our lives, not our possessions
  - Having stories to tell is better than just displaying cold objects
- If you don't buy things, you can invest the saved money; with more money, you can work less and have more time to do happier things
- Home space is for living, not for hoarding desires
- The biggest threat to capitalism is: everyone lives happily ever after with no desire to go out and buy new things.
  - In other words, from capitalism's perspective, staying home comfortably and happily is a form of rebellion.

#### 🏡 Home and Privacy

- A *hygge* home should also provide different types of private spaces
- Privacy isn't just about being alone, it's about our ability to control others' access to us
- Privacy isn't just about separation, it's also about communication
- Sometimes we're in social mode, sometimes we're in solitary mode
- Sometimes we need interaction, other times we need introspection

#### 🪑 Home Atmosphere

- Round tables have no hierarchy

---

#### 🧰 Practical Tips

- Keep a list of fridge food inventory on your phone, so you know what ingredients you have just by checking your phone

My own thoughts:
Suddenly I can't figure out, between location and view, which is more important?

When choosing to buy a house, why focus more on the house's appreciation potential rather than the surrounding community environment?

Of course, if commute time is too long, it shortens time at home, making it hard to enjoy being home.

A comfortable home, even if there's nowhere to go on weekends, wouldn't that also be a form of enjoyment? 🤔

With commute + good environment + comfortable house, of course it's perfect.

But I'm genuinely curious where happiness comes from living somewhere with a poor view.

Perhaps this house value is also a form of "self-comfort," tied to personal achievement and wealth, like buying expensive luxury goods.
