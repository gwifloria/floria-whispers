# Social Attributes: Whose Identity Needs Do They Really Satisfy?

The reason I'm writing this article is that I wanted to buy a backpack. I sent a link to my friend asking for opinion, and my friend said "strong office worker vibes."

I was stunned. I thought, why would someone say a bag has strong office worker vibes? What kind of bag counts as having strong office worker vibes?

I usually quite like buying clothes, and my overall style is quite varied:

Sometimes I like loose hip-hop, sometimes mature and elegant.
Sometimes energetic and cute, sometimes looking like a nun collecting alms.

Recently I've been wanting to buy a super versatile backpack. After all, I often need to carry my laptop out, and backpacks are better for shoulder and neck health.

Though I exercise regularly, I don't expect to use exercise to repay the "posture debt" accumulated daily.

My imagined "office worker vibe" is probably someone looking very haggard, tired, drained.

Someone without "office worker vibes" probably wouldn't give this feeling—they'd present as energetic and confident.

Are items really what carry the "office worker vibes"? I don't think so. Even the least "office worker" bag would look office worker-ish on certain people.

I find this comment quite interesting:

If we think a bag can bring "office worker vibes," doesn't that also mean some items can "de-office-worker-ify"?

Perhaps this is the meaning of luxury goods' existence—they even create an illusion that "I own it = I am the wealthy class."

But luxury goods are daily consumables for financially free people; what they can afford isn't just bags, but also shoes and ready-to-wear etc.

Bags might be accessories some people can barely afford by stretching, but owning a bag doesn't mean a person's class has changed.

I can accept others having this mindset, but I really don't like others defining me by a bag.

This also reminds me of a video I saw before, talking about the "middle class (return to poverty) three essentials: skiing, camping, and hiking."

Of course, in the Xiaohongshu era, these "three essentials" update every few years, and people's hobbies iterate along.

I notice WeChat Moments periodically showing homogenization: everyone's doing surprisingly similar things—weekends taking turns going to concerts, same travel destinations, same photo styles.

I also often wonder, it's normal for people to have multiple hobbies, but why are everyone's hobbies always synchronized?

I used to casually say: "Xiaohongshu hobbies." Now I think this might not count as hobbies—it can only count as desires.

Yesterday I saw a sentence that felt particularly apt: **Perhaps without Xiaohongshu or WeChat Moments, this phenomenon wouldn't exist.**

What people care more about might be the identity labels these activities bring.

A few days ago I listened to a YouZhiYouXing podcast where the guest mentioned meaningless socializing is actually a liability, because many people can't always wear the same outfit—always need some variety, perhaps always wearing the same thing would give off a "living miserably" feeling.

Identity recognition might be the manifestation of herd behavior, which also explains why social features in current apps are so heavy.

Now almost all apps have social features. Every time I download an app, I marvel: why does such a small function app need to be hundreds of megabytes.

Like WeChat Reading—I just want to use it to read books, yet it has to create a reading leaderboard. Many people even leave audiobooks/auto-reading on to rack up hours. Monday morning at 8am, you can already see someone showing "Already read 6 hours this week."

Perhaps long reading time can also bring a label: "I'm more cultured."

So if these social features were cut, wouldn't WeChat Reading's membership numbers be less? :)
