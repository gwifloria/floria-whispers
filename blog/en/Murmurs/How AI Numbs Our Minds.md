#### 01 The Two Sides of Claude Code: Convenience & Bugs

Claude Code has been bothering me lately, and I'm starting to understand why. It's not that the tool doesn't work—it's good enough to handle simple tasks, but not good enough to read my mind. There's always a gap—between what I mean and what I say, between what it assumes and what my codebase actually needs.

It wasn't until I saw AI repeatedly creating bugs—and failing to fix them—that I began to wonder: does Claude Code actually make me more productive?

And here's the thing about human beings: we love shortcuts. When something seems to work automatically, we stop paying attention.

#### 02 When Convenience Becomes a Trap

For those unfamiliar with Claude Code: it has a "plan mode" that shows you exactly what it's about to do before running anything. So you can catch misunderstandings before they turn into problems.

But when I was very tired, I found myself hit Enter before I check the plan or even glance at the plan. It feels effortless and takes less than 1sec.

When something requires no effort, we stop being focused. We're no longer making conscious choices—we're just... clicking. The action becomes automatic, and our attention drifts—to the next thing, the next notification, the next dopamine hit.

#### 03 It’s Not About the Tool — It’s About Attention

This isn't really about Claude Code. It's about attention—and how easily we train ourselves to lose it.

I've been reading _Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise_ and _How to Break Up with Your Phone_. Both books hammer home the same truth: engagement.

"If your mind is wandering or you're relaxed and just having fun, you probably won't improve."

So when we talk about productivity gains from AI tools, we often think less for ourselves but expect more from the tools. That habit may quietly train us to resist deep thinking.

If we're constantly distracted—unwilling to slow down, unwilling to "waste time" really absorbing something—then years from now, will we still be capable of deep or even independent thinking?

#### 04 Don’t Let the Tool Control You

Claude Code is just a tool — we should learn to minimize repetitive work, not let ourselves be dominated by the illusion of doing something that requires no effort or engagement.
