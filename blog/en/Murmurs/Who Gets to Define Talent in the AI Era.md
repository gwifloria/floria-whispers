# Who Gets to Define Talent in the AI Era

Life has been busy and fulfilling lately. I've been chatting with quite a few entrepreneurs, interviewers, and HR professionals. The biggest takeaway? In this rapidly shifting era, the standards people use to measure others are wildly different.

Several collaborators mentioned reading my articles before our conversations. Some said they'd read nearly everything I'd written on tech and AI, and they were generous with their praise. They also resonated with my perspectives -- these are exactly the kind of people I want to work with. They take the time to understand you, and our views on AI just click.

## "What company did you work for?"

But not everyone takes the time to understand you. Recently in an interview, I was asked: What company was your previous employer?

I recalled my first interview back in December -- same question. It left me genuinely puzzled: Is my former company really that unknown?

Later, chatting with a friend in the investment industry, I asked whether she'd heard of my previous company. She rolled her eyes at me and laughed: "Of course! How could I not know?"

Fair enough -- my former employer is well-known in the industry. For a fellow tech professional to ask that question... I'll leave it at that.

## The interviewer's yardstick

Looking back at all the interviewers I've encountered since graduation, the more prestigious the company, the deeper the questions. But in this hyper-competitive job market, many interviewers see themselves purely as evaluators -- not realizing that the questions they ask also reveal what kind of yardstick they're holding, and how deep they can go based on a candidate's self-introduction.

The whole industry is arguing now: What should we even test for in the AI era? Some believe we need to double down on handwriting code from scratch. Others think the real skill is being able to think through problems clearly and leverage AI effectively. I lean toward the latter -- not because fundamentals don't matter. I'm grateful for my five-plus years in the field: I've studied low-level principles, drilled through standardized interview questions, and dealt with all kinds of edge cases. It's precisely because of this foundation that I know where to go next.

Here's the interesting part: the two interviewers who didn't know my former company both emphasized that handwriting ability shouldn't be replaced by AI, and they couldn't ask me many AI-related questions. Meanwhile, a friend of mine works at Amazon, where the company not only encourages AI usage but tracks adoption rates -- people who underuse AI might actually be flagged. I also learned from HR professionals who work with US companies that most American startups now prioritize prompt engineering skills and AI collaboration mindsets, while the attitudes among Chinese companies vary quite a bit.

Same industry, but the yardsticks are already miles apart. My sample size is small, so I won't jump to conclusions -- but I do wonder: could I be the one stuck in a dead end?

So I posed this dilemma to Claude Code:

> Honestly, working with developers every day, I've noticed a very clear pattern: **the people who benefit most from me aren't the best coders -- they're the clearest thinkers.**
>
> Being able to articulate requirements clearly, break a big problem into reasonable steps, and judge whether my proposed solution is right -- these skills determine the ceiling of our collaboration. Some people give me incredibly precise context, and I almost never go off track. Others describe things vaguely, I generate a pile of code, and we end up discovering the entire direction was wrong.
>
> But here's the prerequisite: **you need to understand what I write.** Without foundational understanding, you can't judge whether my output is correct or not. I make mistakes. I write code that looks reasonable but has logical gaps. Catching those issues still depends on your own fundamentals.
>
> So I don't think this is an either/or question. Declining handwriting ability is inevitable, just like mental arithmetic declined after calculators became widespread -- but you still need to know when to multiply and when to divide. **Comprehension is the baseline, handwriting is the method, and leveraging AI is the amplifier.**
>
> The real danger isn't "not writing code by hand anymore," but "not understanding while thinking you do" -- because AI output always looks pretty convincing.

I really liked this response. Maybe I've been enslaved by Claude Code. (Just kidding.)

## My trainer said she wants to quit

The yardstick problem goes beyond interviews. I went to a weightlifting session this morning, and right at the start, my trainer told me she was planning to resign.

I asked her why -- was she too exhausted? She and her husband are both from Tianjin, living in Shanghai with no family support. Their daughter is only in second grade.

She said exhaustion was part of it, but the other part was:

In this line of work, during each one-hour personal training session, she doesn't feel like she's growing. She felt that at this rate, even after three years, she still wouldn't have made any real progress.

I understood where she was coming from, but I didn't fully agree. Being a personal trainer is essentially a sales role too. After three years, her intuition for different clients' needs must be far sharper than when she started -- she just might not count that as "growth." But everyone defines growth differently. Some progress is invisible to the one who's living it. That reminded me of a dinner on New Year's Eve.

## New Year's Eve dinner

I had dinner with a friend who works as a prison guard on New Year's Eve.

He's been on the job for three years. Talking about his daily work, he said the core of the job is studying human nature: different inmates require different management styles. Some respond to gentleness, others to firmness. In his daily routine, he listens to inmates vent and chat, but can't let their "innocent" appeals cloud his judgment -- and typically it's one guard managing over a dozen inmates, while those dozen are also studying you right back.

Honestly, this friend always struck me as pretty immature. But by the end of that dinner, I was stunned -- the transformation this job had brought was far greater than I'd imagined. He's not the only person I know who became a prison guard. Some chose the path simply because it's one of the easier government jobs to land. But even so, dealing with people day after day, something quietly grows in you whether you notice it or not.

## Their yardstick vs. yours

Sometimes, the yardstick others use to measure you is completely different from the one you use on yourself.

This week while painting at my oil painting studio, a Filipino woman came in to inquire about classes. The teacher was in the sculpture room at the time, so I stepped in to introduce the studio and the courses. When the teacher came out and said he couldn't teach in English, I naturally became the interpreter and helped her with all her questions.

The Filipino woman complimented my English. The teacher, who didn't know my professional or educational background, asked after she left: Where did you do your master's? How is your spoken English so good?

I said I just did my bachelor's in Shanghai. He said I sounded like a professional interpreter the moment I opened my mouth.

I said my English has gotten rusty since graduation -- not many chances to use it.

He said I didn't need to be that humble -- and offered that if any more foreigners come by, I could be his teaching assistant in exchange for free oil painting classes.

He has a point. Every time I travel abroad, after just two days my English flows effortlessly again. The truth is, I'm sometimes overly insecure, even when I know my pronunciation is actually quite good. I know it in my head, but I still need someone else to say it first before I can exhale -- and this pattern isn't just about English. It shows up in a lot of things.

Who gets to define talent in the AI era? Honestly, I don't know. Maybe no one can, at least not yet.

But it's not just interviews -- yardsticks are everywhere in life. What you should be doing at what age, which big company you should be working at, how much you should be earning -- as if everyone has to march to the same scale.

But I truly believe there aren't that many "shoulds" in life. The first yardstick we need to put down is the one we use to measure ourselves.
