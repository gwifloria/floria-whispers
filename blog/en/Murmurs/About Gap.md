When I was preparing the review past times. a blog is a plus on the resume 
But i found it meaningless to build a website since there are various blog website or editors which enables users to write airticles conveniently. So If I would like to build a blog website, what outstanding meanings can I 赋能it so that is can be an an interesting website rather than a resume tag

What's more
I don't know how to design a website,I don't know what to else besides blog
Most of the examples can not interest me 

But I have to say, AI Tool does a lot of favor for me. It provides me a lot of inspirations ranging from color to functions.
