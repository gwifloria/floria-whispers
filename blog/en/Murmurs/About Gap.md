When I was preparing for job reviews in the past, I noticed that having a personal blog was always a plus on people's resumes. But honestly, I began questioning whether building my own website really made sense. After all, there are countless blogging platforms and editors out there that make writing and publishing  convenient. So if I'm going to build a blog website, what unique value could I bring to it? How can I make it something genuinely interesting rather than just another resume checkbox?

What's more, I have to admit I'm not a web designer. I don't really know what else to add beyond the basic blog functionality. Most examples I've seen online don't particularly inspire me—they all feel rather similar.

But here's where things get interesting: AI tools have been remarkably helpful. They've given me tons of inspiration, from color palettes to feature suggestions. It's like having a creative partner who helps fill in the gaps in my vision.

I've found myself less confident these years compared to when I first graduated from college. The reason for this might be the classic paradox: the more I've learned, the more I've realized how much I don't know.

This realization made me incredibly anxious when preparing for interviews. There seemed to be so much I needed to learn that I had no idea where to start. I'd set these wildly unrealistic goals for myself, like "build your own React framework in one day." These goals were so enormous that they actually prevented me from starting at all.

I think this kind of anxiety is universal—it doesn't matter what your nationality is or how old you are. When people feel overwhelmed by a huge project, they tend to shift toward easier tasks to comfort themselves. It's a way of avoiding that paralyzing feeling of not knowing where to begin.

This whole approach brought me nothing but stress because I wasn't enjoying the learning process. Maybe I valued the outcome too much, wanting to skip straight to the end result. Or perhaps I convinced myself that the journey wasn't as important as the destination. But actually, the process is what truly matters—it's where the real learning happens.

I've read quite a few books lately, ranging from philosophy and social sciences to software architecture, trying to find better approaches to learning and growth.
