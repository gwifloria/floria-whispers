When I was preparing for job reviews in the past, I noticed that having a personal blog was always a plus on people's resumes. But honestly, I began questioning whether building my own website really made sense. After all, there are countless blogging platforms and editors out there that make writing and publishing  convenient. So if I'm going to build a blog website, what unique value could I bring to it? How can I make it something genuinely interesting rather than just another resume checkbox?

What's more, I have to admit I'm not a web designer. I don't really know what else to add beyond the basic blog functionality. Most examples I've seen online don't particularly inspire me—they all feel rather similar.

But here's where things get interesting: AI tools have been remarkably helpful. They've given me tons of inspiration, from color palettes to feature suggestions. It's like having a creative partner who helps fill in the gaps in my vision.

I've found myself less confident these years compared to when I first graduated from college. The reason for this might be the classic paradox: the more I've learned, the more I've realized how much I don't know.

This realization made me incredibly anxious when preparing for interviews. There seemed to be so much I needed to learn that I had no idea where to start. I'd set these wildly unrealistic goals for myself, like "build your own React framework in one day." These goals were so enormous that they actually prevented me from starting at all.

I think this kind of anxiety is universal—it doesn't matter what your nationality is or how old you are. When people feel overwhelmed by a huge project, they tend to shift toward easier tasks to comfort themselves. It's a way of avoiding that paralyzing feeling of not knowing where to begin.

This whole approach brought me nothing but stress because I wasn't enjoying the learning process. Maybe I valued the outcome too much, wanting to skip straight to the end result. Or perhaps I convinced myself that the journey wasn't as important as the destination. But actually, the process is what truly matters—it's where the real learning happens.

I've been reading quite a bit books from philosophy and social sciences to literature - trying to find better ways to learn and grow.

Lifelong learning is, well, a lifelong thing. So I've started rebuilding my entire learning system. One thing I've realized is how important it is to plan my day in the morning and review it at night. Planning helps me get clear on what I'm going to do, and the daily review helps me see what went well and what didn't.

Here's the thing - when you don't have a plan, you're constantly wondering "what should I be doing right now?" But if I know exactly what I'm supposed to be doing at any given moment, I can focus on doing it _better_ rather than wasting mental energy figuring out what to do next. It's crazy how much this helps.

Think about it - so many people stress over simple things like "what should I eat today?" An adult might literally think about this question a hundred times a day. If I let these kinds of trivial questions bounce around in my head all day, how am I supposed to focus on what actually matters?

Here's the translation:

Reading _The Anxious Generation_ and books about digital minimalism really opened my eyes to how harmful a lot of these apps can be. So many mobile apps are built around social features and recommendation algorithms that basically work like slot machines, constantly triggering dopamine hits. Take WeChat Reading, for example—I'll open it just to continue reading a book, but then the homepage recommendations suck me in and I unconsciously add a whole bunch of books to my shelf. And don't even get me started on apps like Xiaohongshu, Douyin, Bilibili, or WeChat's video channel. A lot of people get into this pattern of bouncing between these platforms, and before they know it, the whole evening's gone.

I've started trying to quit social media and learning to sit with "boredom." In this age of information overload, the truly valuable content usually isn't what the algorithm pushes at you—it's what you actively seek out yourself. Back when information traveled more slowly, people would read the same book multiple times. Now, people speed through even TV shows at 1.5x or 2x, which probably explains why those ultra-short dramas are so popular these days.

What's learning should be?

I reconsidered about my learning habits and my view for study. Our society has become a race where people are always comparing themselves with other people. 

 **Learning should be about discovering your interests, developing critical thinking, and finding meaning.** Yet when education becomes purely instrumental—**a means to outcompete others**—it loses its intrinsic value. We're no longer asking "What do I want to learn?" but rather "What will give me an edge?"
So I found myself reluctant to sit still to learn anything because I want to recite them as soon as possible so that I can seek a job. So definitelly I weigh destination so much over than process. 

The amount of knowledge that a human being  can absorb is limited, which means that if you are continually absorbing information, you can't spare time to connect these suipian information into your own mind network. But this connection is what really matters to each person because learning is a process where you relate your own knowledge to the new one .
