When I was preparing for job reviews in the past, I noticed that having a personal blog was always a plus on people's resumes. But honestly, I began questioning whether building my own website really made sense. After all, there are countless blogging platforms and editors out there that make writing and publishing  convenient. So if I'm going to build a blog website, what unique value could I bring to it? How can I make it something genuinely interesting rather than just another resume checkbox?

What's more, I have to admit I'm not a web designer. I don't really know what else to add beyond the basic blog functionality. Most examples I've seen online don't particularly inspire me—they all feel rather similar.

But here's where things get interesting: AI tools have been remarkably helpful. They've given me tons of inspiration, from color palettes to feature suggestions. It's like having a creative partner who helps fill in the gaps in my vision.

I found myself less confident these years compared to the time when i graduated from college. The reason accounts for it is perhaps the more i  have leaned ,the more lack of knowledge I found myself are.
So I found anxious when i was preparing interviews since I found myself so much need to learn that i have no idea where to start

I always set  unachievable goals like "build your own react in one day". These kinds of goals are too enormous which may prevent you from starting. ADHD is a common problem among people, no matter where your nationality is or what's your age. I think anxiety is  main problem beacuse people will shift to doing something easily to comfort themselves when they feel 无所适从 about this kind of huge project

This kind of process bring nothing but stress to me because I don't enjoy this learning process. Maybe I value the goal too much so that I want to skip the process or I think the process is not as important as the goal. But actually, the process is what we should lay emphasis on

I read a lot books including some philosophy or 社科类书籍 ,as well as architecture.
