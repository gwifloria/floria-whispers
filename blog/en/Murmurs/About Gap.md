When I was preparing for job reviews in the past, I noticed that having a personal blog was always a plus on people's resumes. But honestly, I began questioning whether building my own website really made sense. After all, there are countless blogging platforms and editors out there that make writing and publishing  convenient. So if I'm going to build a blog website, what unique value could I bring to it? How can I make it something genuinely interesting rather than just another resume checkbox?

What's more, I have to admit I'm not a web designer. I don't really know what else to add beyond the basic blog functionality. Most examples I've seen online don't particularly inspire me—they all feel rather similar.

But here's where things get interesting: AI tools have been remarkably helpful. They've given me tons of inspiration, from color palettes to feature suggestions. It's like having a creative partner who helps fill in the gaps in my vision.

I've found myself less confident these years compared to when I first graduated from college. The reason for this might be the classic paradox: the more I've learned, the more I've realized how much I don't know.

This realization made me incredibly anxious when preparing for interviews. There seemed to be so much I needed to learn that I had no idea where to start. I'd set these wildly unrealistic goals for myself, like "build your own React framework in one day." These goals were so enormous that they actually prevented me from starting at all.

I think this kind of anxiety is universal—it doesn't matter what your nationality is or how old you are. When people feel overwhelmed by a huge project, they tend to shift toward easier tasks to comfort themselves. It's a way of avoiding that paralyzing feeling of not knowing where to begin.

This whole approach brought me nothing but stress because I wasn't enjoying the learning process. Maybe I valued the outcome too much, wanting to skip straight to the end result. Or perhaps I convinced myself that the journey wasn't as important as the destination. But actually, the process is what truly matters—it's where the real learning happens.

I've been reading quite a bit books from philosophy and social sciences to literature - trying to find better ways to learn and grow.

Lifelong learning is, well, a lifelong thing. So I've started rebuilding my entire learning system. One thing I've realized is how important it is to plan my day in the morning and review it at night. Planning helps me get clear on what I'm going to do, and the daily review helps me see what went well and what didn't.

Here's the thing - when you don't have a plan, you're constantly wondering "what should I be doing right now?" But if I know exactly what I'm supposed to be doing at any given moment, I can focus on doing it _better_ rather than wasting mental energy figuring out what to do next. It's crazy how much this helps.

Think about it - so many people stress over simple things like "what should I eat today?" An adult might literally think about this question a hundred times a day. If I let these kinds of trivial questions bounce around in my head all day, how am I supposed to focus on what actually matters?

Reading _The Anxious Generation_ and books about digital minimalism really opened my eyes to how harmful a lot of these apps can be. So many mobile apps are built around social features and recommendation algorithms that basically work like slot machines, constantly triggering dopamine hits. Take WeChat Reading, for example—I'll open it just to continue reading a book, but then the homepage recommendations suck me in and I unconsciously add a whole bunch of books to my shelf. And don't even get me started on apps like Xiaohongshu, Douyin, Bilibili, or WeChat's video channel. A lot of people get into this pattern of bouncing between these platforms, and before they know it, the whole evening's gone.

I've started trying to quit social media and learning to sit with "boredom." In this age of information overload, the truly valuable content usually isn't what the algorithm pushes at you—it's what you actively seek out yourself. Back when information traveled more slowly, people would read the same book multiple times. Now, people speed through even TV shows at 1.5x or 2x, which probably explains why those ultra-short dramas are so popular these days.

## What Should Learning Really Be?

I've been reconsidering my learning habits and my entire approach to education. Our society has essentially become a race where people are constantly comparing themselves to others. **Learning should be about discovering your interests, developing critical thinking, and finding meaning.** Yet when education becomes purely instrumental—**a means to outcompete others**—it loses its intrinsic value. We're no longer asking "What do I want to learn?" but rather "What will give me an edge?"

This realization hit home when I examined my own behavior. I found myself reluctant to sit still and truly engage with anything because I was too focused on memorizing it as quickly as possible to land a job. I was definitely weighing the destination far more heavily than the process itself.

**The Limits of Information Absorption**

Here's something that _The Anxious Generation_ and digital minimalism literature emphasize: the human brain has a finite capacity for absorbing information each day. If we're constantly consuming content, what we end up with is a flood of disconnected, fragmented pieces of information. The same principle applies to learning. **Real learning only happens when you have enough focus and mental space to connect new knowledge with what you already know.** That connection—that integration into your existing mental framework—is what actually constitutes genuine understanding.

When you force yourself to "memorize" too much too quickly, your brain can only process isolated fragments. There's no bandwidth left to build those crucial connections. It's the difference between cramming facts into short-term memory and actually developing a coherent understanding of a subject.

**Embracing Imperfection**

What's more, imperfection is the norm, not the exception. Even the most accomplished people have knowledge gaps and struggle with anxiety and uncertainty. The key isn't to eliminate every flaw or fill every gap in your knowledge. Rather, it's about learning to accept yourself and finding your own rhythm.

Perhaps this very experience—this struggle with learning and comparison—is giving me the opportunity to face challenges that others haven't encountered. And maybe that's where unique growth comes from. Not from following the prescribed path perfectly, but from navigating your own imperfect journey.

**Learning Beyond Graduation**

This brings me to a crucial point: **graduation is not the end of learning.** When you treat learning purely as a tool for landing a job, you inevitably start working backward from some artificial deadline. This leads to that all-too-familiar pattern of cramming—what we call "临时抱佛脚" in Chinese, literally "last-minute Buddha-hugging."

But anyone who's crammed knows the truth: this kind of short-term memory is exactly that—short-term. The next time you're job hunting, you'll likely need to cram all over again. If you approach every job change like an exam, only to return to a state of mental chaos afterward, it's no wonder career transitions become exhausting and dreadful.

**A Different Approach**

What if, instead, we viewed learning as a continuous, lifelong practice? Not something you do _for_ something else, but something valuable in itself. The goal shifts from "What do I need to know to get this job?" to "What do I want to understand? What genuinely interests me? What skills will serve me across multiple contexts and changes?"

This mindset doesn't mean abandoning practical goals. Rather, it means recognizing that the most practical approach is often the one that prioritizes genuine understanding over superficial memorization. When you truly grasp something—when you've connected it to your existing knowledge and made it part of your mental landscape—you don't need to relearn it every few years. It stays with you.

In a world that constantly pushes us to optimize, compete, and perform, perhaps the most radical act is to slow down, sit with discomfort, and allow ourselves the space to actually learn—not as a means to an end, but as an end in itself.
