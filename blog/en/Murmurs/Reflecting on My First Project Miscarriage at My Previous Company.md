# Reflecting on My First "Miscarriage" Project at My Previous Company

Recently while reviewing my project experiences, I've been reminiscing about things I did at my previous company.

When I first joined, I mainly reported to backend lead K. Later, a more senior frontend developer G joined the team and became my dotted-line leader.

Fortunately, both leaders were genuinely nice people. During the reporting transition, K told G: "One of my expectations for you is to properly mentor huijue."

During that period before formal reporting started, G often told me: "You're really smart, my goal is to develop you into a project lead."

What left the deepest impression was the first project I led. At that time, the team had 3 co-workers: me, a colleague who was a SJTU graduate student, and leader G. I had three to four more years of work experience than the graduate student. The project started suddenly and urgently, so G handed me the frontend lead role.

Within the project, I was responsible for overall frontend architecture, task breakdown, and progress management. Externally, I coordinated backend API based on development priorities, arranged integration testing, and aligned requirements with product and UI. Since we had been collaborating with other teams for a while, the communication part didn't cause much pressure.

I remember during that period, my GitHub had commits every single day for a month, with 50+ daily commits, all dark green at a glance. Even on Saturday nights, G would come to discuss code optimization. I felt my abilities being rapidly elevated.

(Looking back now, I should have taken screenshots. I used to disdain people who used such things as workload reports in OKR reviews, but now I think even if not for reporting, it could serve as a personal archive.)

As the first person to enter the project, I had to set up the framework first—page layout, component splitting, API wrapping—so colleagues joining later could progress smoothly instead of reinventing the wheel.

Taking on the "project lead" role for the first time, I was indeed in a near "24/7" state: constantly thinking about what could be done better, what was missed, what were my capability gaps. This feeling of pressure and momentum coexisting was both fresh and quite challenging for me.

But during the mid-project on-site demo, there was a requirements deviation. Because front-line information didn't flow back in time, the direction drifted for a while. Facing that situation, I even felt angry initially.

Looking back now, rather than dwelling on external factors, it's better to focus on what I could control. I continued polishing the code to be better.

I remember at the small company before, running to construction sites with the team on weekends, seeing workers' satisfied expressions after on-site demos—that feeling of "the product is actually being used" might be one of the most meaningful positive feedbacks for me.

Shortly after New Year, it was confirmed we didn't win the bid. During the performance review, I asked K about the whole process. He candidly said that yes, the front line didn't report upward in time, there was a communication chain issue.

But later I also understood, perhaps they chose not to report immediately out of some human consideration—if they had spoken up then, probably everyone couldn't have had a good holiday.

Looking back, this isn't unique to the industry or the company. In different teams and environments, there will always be factors beyond our control. And I found what truly bothered me wasn't the project itself, but the emotional drain from "parts I couldn't control."

If this experience taught me anything, it's probably:
**Rather than being dragged by external uncertainties, it's better to define more value and meaning within what you can control.**

Positive feedback doesn't come entirely from outside, and life's meaning isn't entirely defined by work. We need to "seek more inwardly."
