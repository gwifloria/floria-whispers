**My Trip to the Sanyu Exhibition in Hangzhou**

I first learned about Sanyu during my painting class. I randomly picked a painting to copy, and my teacher told me it was a work by Sanyu. He regularly teaches at Shanghai University and knows a lot about Chinese modern art history. Though he mentioned he wasn't necessarily a fan of Sanyu's style, he shared many fascinating stories and details about the artist's life and work.

So when I heard there was going to be a Sanyu's exhibition in Hangzhou, I was excited. As it happened, my husband had a business trip to Hangzhou this week, so I decided to tag along—partly for the exhibition, partly to save on hotel costs.

His office is near Hangzhou West Station in Yuhang, and the exhibition is held at a gallery inside the Xixi Wetland, about a 15-minute drive away.

I went on a sunny afternoon. On my way there, I noticed many greenways lined with trees, which gave me a much better impression of Yuhang. I've been thinking about moving somewhere with more parks and greenery, so this was a pleasant surprise.

After getting off the taxi, I still had to walk five or six minutes to reach the gallery. Along the path, there were many buildings constructed with stone in a style reminiscent of the Ming Dynasty, blending naturally with the surrounding woods. Having grown up in Zhujiajiao, I found this kind of architecture very familiar and comforting...



> I have always believed that reading is the most important thing in life. It writes the weight of existence, and it writes one's contemplation of the relationship with the world—whether it be reading literature, reading music, or reading art.

This sentence immediately set the tone for the entire exhibition. From the moment I walked in, I kept turning it over in my mind. Perhaps this was the sentence that resonated with me most deeply today—it felt like a prelude, inviting everything that followed to be felt and contemplated.

## The Cat on the Chair Came to Life

Music played throughout the gallery. Later, I discovered it was accompanying a video on a large screen.

It brought Chang Yu's abstract, flat figures "into real life."

The "cat on the chair" became three-dimensional, animated; The cat standing on the ox's back actually interacted with the ox in the video. The _Cat Catching a Butterfly_ that I once copied also appeared (I regret not filming it)—in the video, a cat walks toward you while a yellow butterfly flutters in the air.

Through this video, you could almost intuitively imagine: **What the scenes in Chang Yu's mind might have looked like back then.**

In that moment, I marveled at the power of AI, and equally at the curatorial team who could wield AI for such re-creation. How to display, how to express art—not everyone can do it.

## Don't Assume the Worst

The exhibition space was actually quite small. Before setting out, I checked ticket information and, unsurprisingly, found plenty of complaints on Xiaohongshu. I even wavered, thinking maybe it wasn't worth the trip.

But then I thought: the ticket isn't expensive. Even if it's a letdown, it's still part of experiencing life.

As it turned out, I'm glad I wasn't deterred. A 30 yuan round-trip taxi ride plus a 48 yuan ticket—by any measure, not a rip-off. Yes, the venue was small, but this happened to be the most attentive, most careful viewing I've ever given an exhibition.

Maybe because there were few people, and it was quiet enough; Maybe because I already knew a little about Chang Yu, and had copied his work with my own hands; Or maybe because a space of just the right scale naturally invites you to slow down and look.

Before leaving, I flipped through the art books displayed on-site, and without realizing it, lost myself in them for quite a while.

Walking out of the gallery, I suddenly realized—this quiet, leisurely experience was like sipping tea with a hint of sweetness: gentle and refined from the first taste to the lingering aftertaste.

Some activities are more like overly sweet cake—the first bite is thrilling, sending dopamine soaring, but eat too much and all that's left is cloying emptiness.

I find myself increasingly drawn to this kind of **slow happiness**, rather than mistaking excitement for joy.
