# What is React 19 CVE-2025-55182 Critical Vulnerability?

> Original: https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components

## Background

A few days ago during an update deployment, I encountered build failed for the first time. After investigation, I found it was the recently released RSC critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182).

## Vulnerability Essence

React Server Components (RSC) allows clients to call server-side functions, the flow is:

1. Client initiates request → React converts to HTTP request
2. Server receives → React **deserializes** payload → Executes function
3. Returns data to client

**The problem is in step 2:** React didn't restrict prototype chain access during deserialization, attackers can construct malicious payloads to execute arbitrary code on the server **without authentication**.

## Technical Details

### Attack Chain

React Flight Protocol didn't verify if keys exist on the object itself when parsing chunk references, allowing access to `__proto__`:

```javascript
// Key parts of attack payload
"$1:__proto__:then"           // Access then on prototype chain
"$1:constructor:constructor"   // Get Function constructor

// Eventually can execute arbitrary code
Function("process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('...')")
```

### Why Are You Affected Even Without Server Functions?

The vulnerability occurs during **deserialization phase**, before Server Action whitelist verification:

```
Request comes in → Deserialize payload → 💥 RCE already triggered → Whitelist verification (too late)
```

### The Fix

Added `hasOwnProperty` check to block prototype chain access:

```javascript
// After fix
if (hasOwnProperty.call(moduleExports, metadata[NAME])) {
    return moduleExports[metadata[NAME]];
}
return undefined;
```
