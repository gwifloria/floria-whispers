## Part I: The Stagnation Period - Stuck in Place
### Confusion and Stagnation
When I was preparing for my interview, I was told that having a personal blog is highly recommended for front-end developers.  
However, I struggled to find its real meaning — there are already so many beautifully designed blog platforms and editors out there.  I didn’t know what I could build that would make my website stand out from others.

Thankfully, AI has done me a lot of favors — providing new ideas for functionality, interaction, and color palettes.  
It also takes care of a lot of repetitive work for me.
### The Perfectionism Trap
I was confident when I first graduated from school because I had always been a fast learner.  
But the more I learned, the more ignorant I felt.  That ignorance brought fear as well.

I used to set unrealistic goals for myself. When I failed once or twice, I simply stopped trying.  
I tended to focus far more on my weaknesses than on my strengths.  
Eventually, I avoided starting new things altogether — because _no start means no failure._

## Part II: The Exploration Period - Finding Answers in the Gap
### Rebuilding Daily Routines
I used to bounce between apps to ease my anxiety.  But when it became a habit, I realized I had achieved nothing by the end of the day.  That wasn’t the person I wanted to be.

It struck me that I needed to rebuild my daily routines — making schedules, plans, and summaries on a daily and monthly basis (though I admit I’m still not doing it perfectly or consistently).

Having a plan helps me understand my day more clearly.  
It lets me know what I should do at every moment and what I’ve accomplished by the end of the day.  
Without a plan, I end up wasting a lot of time thinking about the same question again and again — like _what should I eat?_ or _what should I do next?_
### Rediscovering Reading
I stopped reading after graduating from school, but I picked it up again during my gap period.  
Among the books I’ve read, those on psychology and philosophy have become my shelter — or perhaps, my lighthouse.

## Part III: Cognitive Reconstruction - Building a New Framework
### Rethinking the Information Environment
I’ve fallen into endless scrolling before, but it never lasted long. It didn’t relax me — it just made me tired.

Books like _How to Break Up with Your Phone_ and _The Anxious Generation_ helped me see how social media works.  
Most apps are built with strong social and recommendation systems — they’re not neutral tools. They’re designed to keep us engaged, sometimes addicted.

In the Chinese book _Cognitive Awakening_ by Zhou Ling, the author mentions that real learning comes from building connections between knowledge what we've already known.  
If the brain is always busy taking in new things, it can’t build those connections and we often end up remembering only fragments.

So I deleted most of my social media apps and tried to get used to boredom.  
It wasn’t easy at first, but it gave me time to think more clearly.  
In an age of endless recommendations, valuable content rarely comes from algorithms — it comes from what we choose to look for ourselves.

People used to reread the same book many times.  Now we even watch TV shows at double speed.  
When I tried that with some HBO series, I realized I missed a lot of details and ideas the director wanted to express.  
Slowing down doesn’t feel natural anymore, but it’s the only way to really see things — and to stay awake in this noisy world.

### Rethinking the Nature of Learning
#### Rethinking the Information Environment
I've also fallen into the trap of endless scrolling phones, but fortunately, that phase didn't last long—I quickly realized it was exhausting rather than relaxing.

Peak and _The Anxious Generation_ helped me realize that many apps aren't "serving" us—they're "dominating" us. Social features and recommendation algorithms trap us like slot machines, constantly triggering dopamine hits.

In _Peak_, the authors mention that our brains have limited capacity for absorbing information every day. When we continuously input without pausing to organize or output, our brains can't connect new knowledge with existing one—and "connection" is the most crucial part of learning. if we don't spare enough time to think about it it is to fall into fragmentation.

So I started shutting down social media and learning to live with "boredom." In the age of information overload, valuable content is rarely what algorithms push to you—it's what you actively seek out. People used to read the same book multiple times;but  now many can't even watch a TV show without speeding it up.

When I was watching TV series, I noticed that playing at faster speeds meant missing the subtle thoughts and details the director embedded in every scene. Only by slowing down can we give our brains enough space to think.
#### The Misconception of Arts vs. Sciences
After graduation, I realized I needed to rebuild my entire knowledge system. My previous approach to learning was purely exam-driven, focused more on "memorizing" than truly "understanding." This method works in the short term but leaves no lasting memory. Many people set learning deadlines for job hunting, but once the goal is achieved, what they learned quickly fades away. Every job hunting becomes like taking another exam

Later I realized this was the aftermath of "test-oriented thinking." We're trained to pursue results, not the process. True learning is about **building connections between different pieces of knowledge**

### Redefining Growth
_Modern Western Thought_ made me reconsider the relationship between people and work. After the Enlightenment, science and rationality were elevated to supreme positions, and people no longer trusted God or metaphysics. In modern times, highly rationalized scientific theories attempt to explain everything through cause and effect, including the meaning of life. Money is something everyone needs, so quantifiable money became the universally accepted measure of life's purpose.

I love this quote from Georg Simmel: "Money is only a bridge to ultimate values, and humans cannot dwell on the bridge."

My family members also work at big tech company, and we often discuss about "the meaning of work." We're easily driven by "meritocracy"—chasing achievements, chasing money, pouring all our positive feedback into work. But life contains too many uncontrollable factors, and luck matters. **Recognition from work is important, but it shouldn't be our only source of value.**

Many of my peers believe work is totally meaningless, falling into passive nihilism. But I don't want that. I still want to maintain curiosity about the unknown, to explore without a specific goal, rather than focusing only on short-term targets and treating the process as suffering. Work and learning can't be completely separated—if we treat the process like playing a game, it naturally becomes enjoyable.

_Peak_ tells us that achieving mastery requires continuous practice—genius is a product of training. My previous choice to avoid practice and deep work was probably falling into the perfectionism trap. **When facing difficulties, we need to persist and push ourselves a bit. Discovering our weaknesses is actually a good thing—it gives us targets for improvement and the optimal path for rapid growth.**

But this "pushing ourselves" needs to be moderate—breaking through the comfort zone step by step, rather than immediately setting harsh goals. _The Anxious Generation_ mentions that anxiety pushes people into defensive mode rather than discovery mode. _Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy_ taught me to handle this anxiety: life and people aren't black and white. I should focus more on my strengths rather than magnifying my weaknesses and completely negating myself. Even when I'm doing nothing, I can enjoy the autumn breeze and appreciate the sunset.

Although human nature leans toward comfort, I hope to see myself climbing a ladder—**reaching the top only to discover I need to build a new ladder to continue climbing**. I don't know where the top is, nor do I need to—I just need to focus on building the ladder.
## Epilogue
Perhaps this  gap experience gave me the chance to face challenges others haven't encountered, gaining unique growth in the process.

I've come to understand:

- **Learning isn't for exams—it's about building connections**
- **Work isn't the meaning of life—it's part of life**
- **Perfection isn't the goal—accepting imperfection is growth**
- **Graduation isn't the endpoint—continuous learning is the norm**

During this gap period, I rebuilt my learning system, my view of work, and my philosophy of life. There's still a long road ahead, but at least now I know I'm moving forward, enjoying every state of life, rather than standing still in confusion.
